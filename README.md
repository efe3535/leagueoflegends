## Configuration

There is no configuration file. The game is installed at
`~/.local/share/leagueoflegends/` by default. If you want to change the default
location of the wine prefix or other parameters, please feel free to modify the
script.


## Usage

### Install the helper script

Please choose either of the two versions. The first one (recommended) depends
on M-Reimer's wine-lol and wine-lol-glibc, and does not require changing kernel
parameters. The second one depends on GloriousEggroll's wine-ge-custom, and
requires setting `abi.vsyscall32=0`, which may have a negative impact on the
performance of other 32-bit wine applications.

For more information about setting kernel parameters at run time and preserving
changes between reboots, please checkout the documentation of your own
distribution. Typically you may want to do something like `echo 'abi.vsyscall32
= 0' >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-league.conf`.

### Install the League client

* First install the game: `leagueoflegends install`.
    * Please do not log in or launch the game during installation.
* When the Riot client appears and if the installation progress stucks at 100%,
  close the window, and run `leagueoflegends install` again.
    * For more detail, check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/qavc89/install_stuck_on_downloading_100/).
* Exit the window when the game installation is finished. (The progress circle
  disappears.)
* Start the game: `leagueoflegends start`.
    * It may take a while (usually less than 5 minutes) before the game shows
      up, due to this
      [issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/j07yrg/starting_the_client_script/).
      Please check out [here](https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49412#c23)
      for more details.
* Log in with your Riot credentials.
* Now the League client should show up. Please try a practice match to make
  sure everything works.
* To remove the game: `leagueoflegends uninstall`.

Note that if you use Nvidia graphics card and have trouble launching the League
client or start the game (after champion selection), please check out [the
troubleshooting section](#blank-screen-with-nvidia-graphics-card).

`leagueoflegends -h` can be used to view the full list of options and commands.

```

### Setting up Garena (Southeast Asia)

* First install Garena: `leagueoflegends install-garena`
    * Choose the region when prompted.
    * There are two wine prefixes (environments) involved in this setup. Both
      Garena and LoL will be installed in `~/.local/share/garena/`. However,
      the game will be launched from the other prefix,
      `~/.local/share/leagueoflegends/`.
    * It's recommended to not change the default location of Garena, which is
      `C:\Program Files\Garena\Garena\`. If you do want to change the default
      location, remember to also change it in the script.
    * Once Garena is successfully installed, it will be automatically started.
      Please log in and go ahead to install LoL from Garena.
    * LoL will by default be installed at `Z:\Garena\Games\`, which is in most
      cases not desirable. Please change it to `C:\Program Files\Garena\Games\`,
      or any other location you desire as long as it is consistent with the
      script variables.
* Exit the Garena window when the game installation is finished.
* Kill the Garena process to finish installation: `leagueoflegends kill-garena`.
    * Because the process will only be minimized to system tray upon exit.
* Start the game: `leagueoflegends start-garena`.
    * This will start Garena. Navigate to LoL and press "Play" from Garena.
    * Similarly, it may take a while (usually less than 5 minutes) before the
      game shows up, due to this
      [issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/j07yrg/starting_the_client_script/).
* To remove the game: `leagueoflegends uninstall-garena`.
* To also remove the environment from which the game is launched:
  `leagueoflegends uninstall`.


## Advanced wine configuration

`leagueoflegends kill` would use `wineserver --kill` to try to kill all the wine
processes of the current wine prefix, which can be helpful if some error
happens and the script hangs.

`leagueoflegends run <...>` can be use to run any command with the wine-related
environment variables, such as `WINEARCH`, `WINEDLLOVERRIDES`, and `WINEPREFIX`.
This way, you could easily run wine utilities like `leagueoflegends run
winecfg`, or `leagueoflegends run winetricks`, etc.


## Troubleshooting

### Blank screen with Nvidia graphics card

If you use Nvidia graphics card and have trouble launching the League client or
start the game (after champion selection), please exit the game (with
`leagueoflegends kill` or `leagueoflegends kill-garena` if you are running the
Garena version) and then try `leagueoflegends rm-dxvk-cache` before restarting
it. This should only need to be done once to clean up the old cache, since DXVK
caching is currently disabled.
([Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/skyg70/fixing_the_nvidia_495_black_screen_crash_problem/))

If the issue still remains, you may want to purge and reinstall the Nvidia
related packages as described
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/r0oo0p/i_got_league_working_again_on_my_nvidia_drivers/).

Alternatively, as a quick (and dirty?) solution, remove the `nvidia` package and
install `nvidia-dkms` instead. Remember to also install the kernel headers
packages according to your kernel (e.g., `linux-headers`). Then reboot and
reinstall LoL.
